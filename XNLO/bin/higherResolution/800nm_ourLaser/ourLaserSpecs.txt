Our laser: 2.5mJ, 800nm, 50fs, 1kHz 
(our laser if it actually ran at its spec: 3mJ, 800 nm, 35fs, 1 kHz)

Notes:
------
2.5mJ = 2.5W
3mJ = 3W
(E = P / RR => P = E * RR)

-So for 50fs, 2.5mJ could do P_av = 0.1W to 2.5W in steps of 0.1W
-And for 35fs, 3mJ could do P_av = 0.1W to 3.0W in steps of 0.1W
