### Unidirectional Pulse Propagation Equation - eXtreme NonLinear Optics - High Harmonic Generation & Propagation
* UPPE - Propagates a laser pulse through a gas-filled hollow capillary.
* XNLO - Calculates the single atom response for a given laser pulse.
* HHGP - Propagates the generated high harmonics through the gas-filled hollow capillary, and into the far-field.
