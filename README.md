## **U**nidirectional **P**ulse **P**ropagation **E**quation

* UPPE - Propagates a laser pulse through a gas-filled hollow capillary.

## e**X**treme **N**on**L**inear **O**ptics

* XNLO - Calculates the single atom response for a given laser pulse.

## **H**igh **H**armonic **G**eneration & **P**ropagation

* HHGP - Propagates the generated high harmonics through the gas-filled hollow capillary, and into the far-field.
