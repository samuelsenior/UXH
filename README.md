### Unidirectional Pulse Propagation Equation

* UPPE - Propagates a laser pulse through a gas-filled hollow capillary.

### eXtreme NonLinear Optics

* XNLO - Calculates the single atom response for a given laser pulse.

### High Harmonic Generation & Propagation

* HHGP - Propagates the generated high harmonics through a gas-filled hollow capillary to the capillary end.
